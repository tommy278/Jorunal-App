# Plan for Adding Design to Next.js App

The current Next.js app is functional but lacks any design. I plan to incorporate the following design elements after I complete learning **Framer Motion**:

### Goals:
   - Add a user-friendly layout to enhance the overall user experience.
   - Integrate smooth animations using Framer Motion for better visual appeal and interactivity.
   - Finalize a consistent and professional color scheme and typography for branding.

### Design Tasks:
   - [ ] Build responsive layouts to ensure compatibility across devices.
   - [ ] Implement animations for page transitions and user interactions.
   - [ ] Define and apply a cohesive color scheme.
   - [ ] Design and style reusable components like buttons, headers, and footers.

### Learning Plan:
   - I will take a short hiatus to focus on learning **Framer Motion** to better understand its capabilities and how to integrate it effectively. Estimated time: 2-3 weeks.

Once I have gained proficiency in Framer Motion, I will revisit this issue to implement the planned design improvements.
